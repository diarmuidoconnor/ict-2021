## Global Data and Contexts.

A common feature of React apps is when many components meed to access the same piece of data. For example, many components may need to know the current authenticated user's username/id. This situation can lead to 'prop drilling', where components in the middle of the component hierarchy must pass props from high-level components to low-level components - the middle-tier components do not use the props themselves. Another common (related) implementation problem is when a component requests API data every time it remounts, even though the data is unchanged from the first mounting. This case arises in our app for the list of Discover movies and the list of genres. The genres never change, while the movie list may change between app runs but not during a single execution session.

React's provides Contexts to solves both of these problems - it is an implementation of the generic Provider design pattern.

### The Movie list context.

Create the file `src/contexts/moviesContext.js` and add this code:

```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { getMovies } from "../api/tmdb-api";

export const MoviesContext = React.createContext(null);

const MoviesContextProvider = (props) => {
  const [movies, setMovies] = useState([]);

  const addToFavorites = (movieId) => {
    setMovies((movies) => {
      const updatedMovies = movies.map((m) =>
        m.id === movieId ? { ...m, favorite: true } : m
      );
      return updatedMovies;
    });
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    getMovies().then((movies) => {
      setMovies(movies);
    });
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, []);

  return (
    <MoviesContext.Provider
      value={{
        movies: movies,
        addToFavorites: addToFavorites,
      }}
    >
      {props.children}
    </MoviesContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default MoviesContextProvider;
```

At one level the MoviesContextProvider component is not exceptional - it simply manages the loading and modifying (via addToFavorites function) of the movie list. It can be composed with other components by using the Container pattern - _props.children_. Where it is different is it also operates as a _context provider_ due to the _MoviesContext.Provider_ wrapper. This gives other components access to the movies array and addToFavorites function, termed the provider's _values_.

---

Aside: The setter function returned by useState can be used in two ways. The simplest is where its parameter is the new value for the state variable,

> e.g. setMovies([... new movies array ...])

Alternatively, its argument can be a callback function which implements the logic for mutating the state,

> e.g. setMovies(callback)

This alternative usage is demonstrated in the above code.

---

In `src/index.js`:

- add an import

```
import MoviesContextProvider from "./contexts/moviesContext";
```

- and modify the App component:

```
const App = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <SiteHeader />
      <MoviesContextProvider>
        <Switch>
          ..... other routes as before .......
        </Switch>
      </MoviesContextProvider>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

The App component _composes_ the MoviesContextProvider with the rest of our components. All components can now access the _values_ contained in the context, subject to a small code addition. For example, the home page can access the movies list. In fact, most of that page's functionality has moved to the context provider component. Completely replace the content of `pages/homePage.js` with the following:

```
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import PageTemplate from "../components/templateMovieListPage";
import { MoviesContext } from "../contexts/moviesContext";

const HomePage = (props) => {
  const context = useContext(MoviesContext);
  const { movies, addToFavorites } = context;

  return (
    <PageTemplate
      title="Discover Movies"
      movies={movies}
      selectFavorite={addToFavorites}
    />
  );
};

export default HomePage;
```

The important line above is:

```
  const context = useContext(MoviesContext);
```

The useContext hook allows a component _consume_ the values exposed by the context provider. An additional benefit of elevating the list od movies up to the context provider is the Favorite Movies page can now compute the list of favorites itself - we no longer need to store them in the browser's local storage. In `pages/favoriteMoviesPage.js` replace the entire content with:

```
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import PageTemplate from "../components/templateMovieListPage";
import { MoviesContext } from "../contexts/moviesContext";

const FavoriteMoviesPage = () => {
  const context = useContext(MoviesContext);
  const { movies  } = context;
  const favoriteMovies = movies.filter(m => m.favorite  )

  const toDo = () => true;

  return (
    <PageTemplate
      title="Favorite Movies"
      movies={favoriteMovies}
      selectFavorite={toDo}
    />
  );
};

export default FavoriteMoviesPage;
```

In the browser try the following sequence:

1. Go to the home page.
1. Click the 'Favorites' icon of the first three movies - they each have a red favorite icon in the title.
1. Navigate to the Favorites page. It's showing the tagged movies.
1. Navigate back to the Home page. The three movies are still tagged as favorites. The app did not re-request the full list of movies from the API, as was previously the case.

### The Genre list context.

Create the file `src/contexts/genresContext.js` and add this code:

```

import React, { useState, useEffect, createContext } from "react";
import { getGenres } from "../api/tmdb-api";

export const GenresContext = createContext(null)

const GenresContextProvider = props => {
const [genres, setGenres] = useState([{ id: "0", name: "All" }]);
useEffect(() => {
getGenres().then(allGenres => {
setGenres([genres[0], ...allGenres]);
});
// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, []);

    return (
        <GenresContext.Provider
          value={{
            genres
          }}
        >
          {props.children}
        </GenresContext.Provider>
    )

}

export default GenresContextProvider;

```

As before, we compose this context provider component with the rest of the app's components. In `src/index.js` complete the composition as follows:

- add an import:

```

import GenresContextProvider from "./contexts/genresContext";

```

- and modify the App component:

```

const App = () => {
return (
<BrowserRouter>
<div className="jumbotron">
<SiteHeader />
<div className="container-fluid">
<MoviesContextProvider>
<GenresContextProvider> {/_ NEW _/}
<Switch>
. . . as before . . .
</Switch>
</GenresContextProvider> {/_ NEW _/}
</MoviesContextProvider>
</div>
</div>
</BrowserRouter>
);
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));

```

Finally, in `compoonents/filterMoviesCard/index.js` make the following changes:

- add some imports:

```

import React, { useContext } from "react";
import { GenresContext } from '../../contexts/genresContext'

```

- remove an import:

```
import { getGenres } from "../../api/tmdb-api";
```

- In the FilterMoviesCard component, add these statements:

```
  const context = useContext(GenresContext);
  const { genres } = context
```

- and remove the useState and useEffect hook calls (they are now in the provider component).

In the browser check the filtering still works.

Update the git repository, as follows:

```

$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Refactor: Movie list and genre list now stored in contexts"
$ git push origin main

```

```

```

```

```
