# Paramaterised URLs

You will now update the movies Router to implement the **GET /api/movies/:id** and **GET /api/movies/:id/reviews** endpoints


## GET a Movie

+ In **/api/movies/index.js**, add the following code just under the ``router.get(..);`` function to process **GET /api/movies/:id** endpoint:

```javascript
// Get movie details
router.get('/:id', (req, res) => {
    const id = parseInt(req.params.id);
    if (movieDetails.id == id) {
        res.status(200).json(movieDetails);
    } else {
        res.status(404).json({
            message: 'The resource you requested could not be found.',
            status_code: 404
        });
    }
});
```

The above code gets the movie id from the URL path and uses it to find and return the movie in the response. We only have one movie in our test data for this endpoint at the moment so, if the ID does not match 527774, it returns a standard 404 response. 

- Test with your HTTP Client using the ID 527774. Also, check that a 404 is returned if another ID if used.

## Get a Movie Review

To implement movie reviews endpoint, we will return the list example review data we used in the last lab(exercises section). As before, it will suffice for now to use a reviews list for just one movie. 

+ In **/api/movies/index.js**, add the following code to process **GET /api/movies/:id/reviews** endpoint:


```javascript
// Get movie reviews
router.get('/:id/reviews', (req, res) => {
    const id = parseInt(req.params.id);
    // find reviews in list
    if (movieReviews.id == id) {
        res.status(200).json(movieReviews);
    } else {
        res.status(404).json({
            message: 'The resource you requested could not be found.',
            status_code: 404
        });
    }
});
```

Test again using a Rest client by doing a **HTTP GET** using the  URL.

 > http://localhost:8080/api/movies/527774/review

Using Postman, you should see something similar to the following: 

![Update Movie (HTTP Put)](./img/put.png)

## Add a Movie Review

If you refer to the API definition in Swagger from the last lab, we specified that the body of the *POST /api/movies/:id/reviews* would be as follows:

~~~json
{
  "author": "string",
  "content": "string"
}
~~~

You will now add the endpoint to the router that will access the request body and add additional properties required for the review: ``created_at``, ``updated_at``, and ``id``.

+ Add the necessary middleware to parse JSON data in the request body. Open the entry point script, **index.js** in the root folder (**node-lab1**), and add the express.json() function to the middleware stack **before the moviesRouter is added** (remember middleware is used in the order it appears) :

  ~~~javascript
  app.use(express.json());
  ~~~

+ Open a command line **in the lab-node1** folder and install the following package:

  ~~~bash
  npm install --save uniqid
  ~~~

This module will be used to compute a random ID for a new review. Ultimately, the Mongo DB will do this.

+ Open the movies router, **/api/movies/index.js** and add the following import statement  and new endpoint  to the existing code

```javascript
import uniqid from 'uniqid'

...

//Post a movie review
router.post('/:id/reviews', (req, res) => {
    const id = parseInt(req.params.id);
    
    if (movieReviews.id == id) {
        req.body.created_at = new Date();
        req.body.updated_at = new Date();
        req.body.id = uniqid();
        movieReviews.results.push(req.body); //push the new review onto the list
        res.status(201).json(req.body);
    } else {
        res.status(404).json({
            message: 'The resource you requested could not be found.',
            status_code: 404
        });
    }
});

```

+ Now check it using **Postman**,  or other means, using the following URL and JSON body shown in the image below (localhost:8080/api/movies/527774/reviews). It should return the updated review object as shown.

![Posting Movie Review](./img/review.png)  

+ Also, if you use a different id in the URL, it will return a 404 status message.
