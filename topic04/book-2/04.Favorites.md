## Choosing favorite movies.

On the Home page we can tag a movie as one of our favorites by clicking its 'Favorite' icon. This will cause the related card to show a red Favorite Icon on the title bar. As a temporary solution we will record a tagging by adding a 'favorite' property to the movie object and set it to true. But realistically they should be persisted to a database, via an API. 

![][favorites]

The inverse data flow (Data down, Action up) pattern will again be used in this aspect of the app. In `pages/homePage.js`, make the following changes:
~~~
const MovieListPage = (props) => {
  ..... as before .......

  const addToFavorites = (movieId) => {
    const updatedMovies = movies.map((m) =>
      m.id === movieId ? { ...m, favorite: true } : m
    );
    setMovies(updatedMovies);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    ..... as before .....
  }
~~~
and replace the line:
~~~
   <MovieList movies={displayedMovies} />
~~~
with this:
~~~
    <MovieList movies={displayedMovies} selectFavorite={addToFavorites} />
~~~
In `components/movieList/indes.js` replace the line:
~~~
    <Movie key={m.id} movie={m} />
~~~
with this:
~~~
    <Movie key={m.id} movie={m} selectFavorite={props.selectFavorite} />
~~~
In `components/movieCard/index.js` add an event handler:
~~~
export default function MovieCard(props) {
  ..... as before .......

  const handleAddToFavorite = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    props.selectFavorite(movie.id);
  };

  return (
    ...........
~~~
Replace the line:
~~~
    <CardHeader className={classes.header} title={movie.title} />
~~~
with this:
~~~
    <CardHeader
      className={classes.header}
      avatar={
        movie.favorite ? (
          <Avatar className={classes.avatar}>
            <FavoriteIcon />
          </Avatar>
        ) : null
      }
      title={
        <Typography variant="h5" component="p">
          {movie.title}{" "}
        </Typography>
      }
    />
~~~
[ Until now props have either been data objects or callback functions. However a component can also be a prop as with the title prop above. Later we will develop our own components that accept other components as props.]
In the same file replace the lines:
~~~
    <IconButton aria-label="add to favorites" onClick={null}>
      <FavoriteIcon color="primary" fontSize="large" />
    </IconButton>
~~~
with this:
~~~
    <IconButton aria-label="add to favorites" onClick={handleAddToFavorite}>
        <FavoriteIcon color="primary" fontSize="large" />
    </IconButton>
~~~
Finally, add a import at the top:
~~~
import Avatar from "@material-ui/core/Avatar";
~~~
The overall flow in the above implementation is when the clicks a movie card's Favorite icon the event handler invokes the callback provided by the HomePage. The callback sets the movie's favorite property. This state change causes the HomePage to re-render. The selected MovieCard displays a red Favorite icon in its title because the associate movie object has the favorite property set to true.   

We need a new view to display the list of favorites. Its layout will be identical to the home page. To code this without violating the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) requires some refactoring - see next section. As a placeholder, create the file `src/pages/favoriteMoviesPage.js` and add this code:
~~~
import React from "react";

const FavoriteMoviesPage = () => {
    return <h2>Favorite Movies</h2>
}

export default FavoriteMoviesPage
~~~
Update the routing configuration and for convenience we will also add a simple site navigation bar as well. In `src/index.js` replace the App component with the following:
~~~
.... other imports .....
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Redirect, Switch, Link } from "react-router-dom";
import FavoriteMoviesPage from "./pages/favoriteMoviesPage"; // NEW

const App = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to="/movies/favorites">Favorites</Link>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/movies/favorites" component={FavoriteMoviesPage} />
        <Route path="/movies/:id" component={MoviePage} />
        <Route exact path="/" component={HomePage} />
        <Redirect from="*" to="/" />
      </Switch>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
 ~~~
When the routing configuration changes we must restart the development server:
~~~
$ npm start
~~~
In the browser check the new navigation links at the top left are working.

The app has a bug! Try the following sequence:

1. Go to the home page.
1. Click the 'Favorites' icon of the first three movies.
1. Notice, the selected movies are tagged, as expected. 
1. Navigate to the Favorites page.
1. Navigate back to the Home page. The three selected movies are no longer tagged. This is due to the useEffect hook querying the API every time the home page component is mounted. We will fix this issue in the next lab - I promise!
