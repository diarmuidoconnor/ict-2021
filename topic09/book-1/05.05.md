# Express Routing

Express gives us an easy way of mapping specific URL paths to Javascript functions. You will now replicate the functionality from the "Hello World" section so that a **HTTP GET** request for the URL path  '/greeting/' will respond with "Hello World". Modify the index.js by adding an ``app.get([route],[callback function])``.

## Postman

In the absence of Unit/Integration tests, you will need a HTTP client to manually test your APIs. Postman is currently one of the most popular tools used in API testing. 

You can install it from  [here](https://www.postman.com/).

There is good documentation on how to use it to test APIs. It will be used in the following exercises to rest the APIs...

**Note**: there are other tools you can use also - feel free to opt for them if you wish.


### Implementing the Movies API

You will now create a Movies router that will take care of all requests on the "/api/movies/*" path. 

- In the /api/movies folder, create a new file called **index.js** and enter the following javascript:

~~~javascript
import express from 'express';
import { movies, movieReviews, movieDetails } from './moviesData';

const router = express.Router(); 
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.json(movies);
});

export default router;
~~~


- Now update **index.js** in the **root** folder to use the new movies routing script by replacing the entire contents with the following code:

~~~javascript
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import express from 'express';
import moviesRouter from './api/movies';

dotenv.config();

const app = express();

const port = process.env.PORT;

app.use('/api/movies', moviesRouter);

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.info(`Server running at ${port}`);
});
~~~

- Now test the application again by doing a HTTP GET on ``localhost:8080/api/movies``. You should see something similar to the following:
